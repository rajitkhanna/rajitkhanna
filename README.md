### Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px"> - I'm [Rajit](https://rajitkhanna.com)

I'm a master's student in computer science at Georgia Tech, studying machine learning.

In my free time, I like to think about what it means to live well in the 21st century at my [blog](https://rajitkhanna.com) and talk about it on my [podcast](https://rajitkhanna.com/podcast).

Here's a few projects I'm currently working on:
- [Am I A Chad](https://github.com/rajitkhanna/amiachadapp), a mobile app that lets users measure themselves against certain fitness standard.
  - Vision: on login, users fill out a form that lets them create a "Chad" score based on their performance on the exercises. This app lets them display a widget on their Home Screen or Apple Watch that they can update as they become more Chad.
  - To Dos:
    - [ ] add signup / login flow
    - [x] add exercise names, rep ranges, and weight limits
    - [x] add UI components for indicating weight + number of reps 
    - [ ] create scroll list for list of exercises
    - [ ] add exercises images / videos
    - [ ] add page for displaying Chad Score on the app
    - [ ] use WidgetKit to create a Chad Score widget
- [Rajit Search](https://github.com/rajitkhanna/search_engine), a search engine that highlights differences of opinion and promotes dialogue and independent research.
  - Vision: this app arose from the confusion I experienced researching health supplements; I would read one source claim a substance is beneficial and another claim it's toxic. I wanted to create a space to view multiple sources at once and compare and contrast the evidence. This app makes a query to a search engine and creates a visualization of all the sources that reflects whether each source feels positively or negatively about the given search query. It indicates which sources are considered more reliable. 
- [AlfredAI](https://github.com/rajitkhanna/AlfredAI), a wearable AI device that will replace my phone.
  - To Dos:
    - [ ] enable this AI to direct me on Google Maps
    - [ ] enable this AI to search along my route for things I might find interesting via Google Maps
    - [ ] enable this AI to read me my messages via Texts.com / Beeper
    - [ ] only let this device listen when I want it to (toggle the mic on and off)
    - [ ] give the device cellular access (buy LTE hat)


Future ideas:
- DIY volumetric rig for workout analysis using Instant-3D
- YouTube but it prompts users after each video for where they'd like to go next to prevent echochambers.
- Mandem bracelet (distress bracelet for a group of friends in a <1 mi area)
