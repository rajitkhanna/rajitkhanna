### Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px"> - I'm [Rajit](https://rajitkhanna.com)

I'm a master's student in computer science at Georgia Tech, studying machine learning.

In my free time, I like to think about what it means to live well in the 21st century at my [blog](https://rajitkhanna.com) and talk about it on my [podcast](https://rajitkhanna.com/podcast).

Here's a few projects I'm currently working on:
- [Am I A Chad](https://github.com/rajitkhanna/amiachadapp), a mobile app that lets users measure themselves against certain fitness standard.
  - [ ] Add auth
- [Rajit Search]()

- [AlfredAI]()
