I'm a master's student in computer science at Georgia Tech, studying machine learning.

In my free time, I like to think about what it means to live well in the 21st century at my [blog](https://rajitkhanna.com) and talk about it on my [podcast](https://rajitkhanna.com/podcast).

    - [x] add UI components for indicating weight + number of reps 
    - [ ] create scroll list for list of exercises
    - [ ] add exercises images / videos
    - [ ] add page for displaying Chad Score on the app
    - [ ] use WidgetKit to create a Chad Score widget
- [Rajit Search](https://github.com/rajitkhanna/search_engine), a search engine that highlights differences of opinion and promotes dialogue and independent research.
